# to-do-list

Take-Home Exercise: To-do List App

1. Populate the to-do list with data fetched from the server
2. Implement functionality to add a new to-do, which should also save it to the server 
3. Implement functionality to mark to-dos as completed or not completed

Files included:
index.html,
scripts.js,
style.css,
README

I was able to complete #1 and half of #2 but not #3. I spent several hours but got stuck. This exercise was a great learning experience for me and made me realize where my weaknesses are. 

Thank you for the opportunity!
